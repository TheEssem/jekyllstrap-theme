# [This is JekyllStrap.](https://github.com/TheEssemCraft/jekyllstrap-theme)
JekyllStrap is yet another Bootstrap 3 theme for Jekyll, brought to you by Essem. It has support for categories, pagination, Disqus comments, a recent posts menu across the site, and more.

JekyllStrap is designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind. Since it has Bootstrap baked in, JekyllStrap is mobile-friendly by default, so you don't have to worry about making sure your posts display correctly on mobile devices.
