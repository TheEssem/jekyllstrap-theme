# jekyllstrap-theme

JekyllStrap is yet another Bootstrap 3 theme for Jekyll, brought to you by Essem. It has support for categories, pagination, Disqus comments, a recent posts menu across the site, and more.

JekyllStrap is designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind. Since it has Bootstrap baked in, JekyllStrap is mobile-friendly by default, so you donâ€™t have to worry about making sure your pages display correctly on mobile devices.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyllstrap-theme.gemspec` accordingly.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
