# JekyllStrap
JekyllStrap is yet another Bootstrap 3 theme for Jekyll, brought to you by Essem. It has support for categories, pagination, Disqus comments, a recent posts menu across the site, and more.

JekyllStrap is designed with simplicity and minimalism in mind. Since it has Bootstrap baked in, JekyllStrap is mobile-friendly by default, so you donâ€™t have to worry about making sure your posts display correctly on mobile devices.

## Setup

### Method 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

#### IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS THEME ON THE MAIN DIRECTORY OF YOUR SITE, THE INSTRUCTIONS TO DO SO ARE IN THE MASTER BRANCH!

Step 1: Fork the JekyllStrap repository to your GitHub account.

Step 2: In the settings, rename the repo to whatever you want.

Step 3: Edit the `_config.yml` file in the root of the repository. Here's what each field means:

* `title` - Your name or the title of your website (e.g. 'My Amazing Site', 'John Smith')

* `url` - The main URL of your website WITHOUT any directories (e.g. 'https://username.github.io', not 'https://username.github.io/blog')

* `baseurl` - The name of your repo with a slash behind it (e.g. '/blog', '/product')

* `disqus_shortname` - The (Disqus)[https://disqus.com] shortname of your website; only required if you want comments on your posts/pages (e.g. 'johnsblog', 'my-hobby-site')

Step 4: You're done! You can view your site at https://yourgithubusername.github.io/yourrepositoryname
